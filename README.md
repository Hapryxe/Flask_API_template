# Flask_API_template
Tired of always writing your Flask API from scratch or stealing code snippets from old Projects? Use the Template!

To use the template you need a somewhat new version of Python and well... Flask.

Dont worry if the HTML file throws errors. Its just the standard HTML Interpreter freaking out because it doesnt know Flask arguments.
